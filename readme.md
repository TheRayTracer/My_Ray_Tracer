# My Ray Tracer
### About
This project started life for an advanced graphics course. This implementation is a fully functional Whitted-style ray tracing framework supporting reflections, refractions, and shadows. The framework is capable of parsing scene description files supporting simple geometric primitives and models.

### Building
The source code was initially developed on Unix systems using the g++ compiler, but has since been migrated to using Microsoft's Visual Studio. Although it has been a number of years, it should still build on g++ (or require minimal effort to compile on g++).
